![The Lunga Drum](/images/forsale/lunga.jpg)

The lunga is a double-headed hourglass shaped tension drum carved from the Shea 
Butter tree. By squeezing and pulling on the leather cords, the player can change the 
tension and thus the pitch of the drum. Pitches can vary over an octave and many 
intervals can be attained. In the hands of an expert, the drum becomes a way of 
communicating Dagbani, the spoken language of the Dagomba people. Many styles of 
Ghanaian music are based upon speech, therefore the bond between language and 
music are so intimate that it is actually possible to tune and play an instrument so that 
the music it produces is linguistically comprehensible. These drums come in two sizes 
- Medium and large.
