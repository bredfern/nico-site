![The Gungon Drum](/images/forsale/gungon.jpg)

The Gungon is a medium sized cylindrical bass drum used to accompany the Lunga. It is 
a double headed drum with snares on each head. It produces a rich bass tone when 
struck in the middle and has a wide array of overtones and buzz when played above the 
snares. These also come in medium and large sizes.
